# modern-angular-bootcamp-password-generator

I'm primarily a Java developer trying Angular/TypeScript for the first time.

This is my implementation of the password generator created in Section 2 of the Udemy course _The Modern Angular Bootcamp [2020]_ course by Stephen Grider.

I've tweaked the requirements and design to fit my own development preferences.
